It is linked contextually from the “AI Architecture, Governance & Secure Implementation” pillar in the What We Do page.

Must answer: “How do you architect AI systems properly at enterprise scale?”

Purpose:
Demonstrate architectural discipline, TOGAF alignment, SDLC rigour, and security-by-design maturity.

---

### 1. Architecture Philosophy

AI systems must be architected — not assembled.

We begin with business capability mapping and trace through:
• Business Architecture  
• Data Architecture  
• Application Architecture  
• Technology Architecture

TOGAF principles inform how we structure capability, traceability, and governance.

We do not start with models.
We start with enterprise structure.

---

### 2. AI-Native Reference Architecture
