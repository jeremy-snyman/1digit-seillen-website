Before investing in AI, you need to understand your starting point. Without a structured assessment, organisations risk investing in the wrong areas and creating expensive failures.

## The Five Pillars of AI Readiness

At 1Digit, we evaluate AI readiness across five interconnected pillars:

### 1. Leadership & Strategy

Is your executive team aligned on AI objectives? Do you have a formal AI strategy with clear ownership and investment governance?

### 2. Data Maturity

How unified is your data estate? Do you have quality monitoring, lineage tracking, and self-service access?

### 3. Platform Architecture

Is your infrastructure cloud-native, scalable, and AI-optimised? Can it handle real-time data processing?

### 4. Governance & Risk

Do you have AI governance frameworks? How do you manage bias, security, and regulatory compliance?

### 5. Operational Readiness

Do you have the skills, processes, and tooling to deploy and maintain AI systems in production?

## Why Benchmarking Matters

A structured benchmark provides:

- **Clarity** — know exactly where your strengths and gaps are
- **Prioritisation** — invest in the areas that will have the most impact
- **Confidence** — make investment decisions based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Accountability** — track progress over time against a defined baseline
