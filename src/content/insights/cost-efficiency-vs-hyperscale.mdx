Hyperscaler data warehousing is powerful. Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery have transformed how organisations work with data. But they come with significant costs that many enterprises are only now beginning to fully understand.

## The Hidden Costs of Hyperscale

Beyond the headline pricing, hyperscaler data platforms carry costs that compound:

- **Compute charges** that scale faster than data volume
- **Egress fees** that penalise data movement
- **Licensing complexity** that makes budgeting unpredictable
- **Vendor lock-in** through proprietary formats and APIs

For many enterprise workloads, these costs exceed the value delivered.

## The European Alternative

European cloud providers like IONOS offer enterprise-grade infrastructure at significantly lower cost points. The savings come from:

- **Lower base pricing** — European cloud economics without hyperscaler margins
- **No egress fees** — within-network data movement at no additional cost
- **Open standards** — no proprietary format lock-in
- **Sovereign data** — GDPR-compliant by design, no transatlantic transfers

## Smart Lakehouse on IONOS

At 1Digit, we have architected the [Smart Lakehouse on IONOS](/smart-lakehouse-ionos) — a managed data platform that delivers enterprise analytics and AI capability at a fraction of hyperscaler costs.

Built on open-source technologies including Trino, Apache Kafka, and Apache Iceberg, the Smart Lakehouse provides:

- Managed lakehouse environment
- Distributed SQL query engine
- Self-service analytics
- AI/ML pipeline integration
- Full governance and observability

## Making the Switch

Transitioning from a hyperscaler to a more cost-efficient platform does not have to be disruptive. Our approach is incremental:

1. **Assess** current costs and workload characteristics
2. **Architect** the target platform with migration path
3. **Migrate** workloads in priority order with validation at each step
4. **Optimise** for cost and performance post-migration
